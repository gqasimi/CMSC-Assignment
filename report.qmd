# CMSC 408 Assignment Report Homework 1

## Overview of the 9 Larger Categories

### 1. Access Control Management Systems
**What It Does:** 
Access control management systems manage who has access to specific data and resources within a database.

**Importance:** 
Ensuring that only authorized users can access certain data is crucial for maintaining security and privacy.

**Difference from Relational OLTP Databases:**
 Unlike OLTP databases, which focus on transaction processing, access control systems focus on defining and enforcing policies for data access.

**Why It Interests Me:** 
Iâ€™m particularly interested in this category because it aligns with my project focus on database access control, providing a secure environment for data management.

### 2. Data Security and Privacy Tools
What It Does: Protects sensitive data from unauthorized access.
Importance: Critical for maintaining trust and compliance.
Difference from OLTP: Focuses on data protection, not transactions.
Interest: Vital for securing access-controlled environments.

### 3. Metadata Management Tools
What It Does: Manages data about data (e.g., data lineage).
Importance: Ensures data accuracy and governance.
Difference from OLTP: Deals with data context, not just storage.
Interest: Key for understanding and managing data assets.

I found this assignment both challenging and rewarding. The part I enjoyed most was exploring the various categories of tools,
 particularly those related to access control management. One difficulty I encountered was getting familiar with Quarto and the new workflow. Next time, 
 I would start earlier to give myself more time to explore the tools and refine my work. Overall, 
 this assignment helped me gain a better understanding of the tools and practices used in data engineering, 
 which will be invaluable in my future projects.
