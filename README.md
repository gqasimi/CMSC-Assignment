## Deliverable 12: Access Control Management System (ACMS) by Ghulam Mujtaba Qasimi

This deliverable involves designing, implementing, and documenting an Access Control Management System (ACMS) database.
The tasks include creating a schema, performing CRUD operations, running queries, and generating a report using Quarto.

## Deliverable Tasks

The following steps were completed as part of this project:
1 - Database Schema:
Designed and implemented the ACMS schema in MySQL, including tables for Users, Roles, Permissions, Role_Permissions, User_Roles, and Audit_Log.

2 - CRUD Operations:
Developed a Flask application to perform Create, Retrieve, Update, and Delete operations for Users, Roles, and Permissions.
Verified CRUD operations using Postman and screenshots were documented.

3 - Query Testing:
Tested 20 queries on the ACMS schema, including user-role relationships, permissions per role, and audit log details.
Documented query outputs with screenshots for each.

4 - Report Generation:
Created the report.qmd file to document the project.
Rendered the report into an HTML file using Quarto, including screenshots of CRUD operations and query results.

5 - Video Presentation:
Recorded a narrated video to demonstrate the system in action, covering CRUD operations, query outputs, and reflections on the project.

## Reflection and Future Considerations

The project successfully met all objectives, including database design, CRUD operations, and query testing.
Future enhancements could include implementing a more advanced web interface with Bootstrap and adding user authentication for better security.
